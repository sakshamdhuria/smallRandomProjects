# Judgement Game Simulation

This project is a C++ simulation of a card game:Judgement where players make predictions about the number of hands they will win and earn points based on the accuracy of their predictions.

## Overview

The game simulates a series of rounds in which players predict how many hands they will win. Each round, a starting player is chosen based on the game number, and players take turns making their predictions. 
The program keeps track of each player's score, updating it based on how close their predictions were to the actual outcomes.

## How to Use

### Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Standard C++ library headers (e.g., `<bits/stdc++.h>`)

### Compilation

To compile the code, run:

```bash
g++ -o judgement judgement.cpp
